      <h1>About compete4moris</h1>
      <p>While it is common knowledge that academic competitions hold an important place in education, finding the right competition as a student can be daunting especially in Mauritius where the few available competitions fly under the radar of educators and students. </p>
      <p>compete4moris aims to simplify the process of searching for competitions : By compiling high-quality competitions in a bite-size format, students can easily find a competition that interests them. Even though comptete4moris focuses on local competitions in Mauritius, some noteworthy international competitions have also been included in the list to encourage students to go beyond the national scope.</p>
