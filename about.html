      <h1>About compete4moris</h1>
      <p>While it is common knowledge that academic competitions hold an important place in education, finding the right competition as a student can be daunting especially in Mauritius where the few available competitions fly under the radar of educators and students. </p>
      <p>compete4moris aims to democratize access to competitions : By compiling high-quality competitions in a bite-size format, students can easily find a competition that interests them. Even though compete4moris focuses mainly on competitions in Mauritius, some noteworthy international competitions have also been included in the list to encourage students to go beyond the national scope.</p>
