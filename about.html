        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>While it is common knowledge that academic competitions hold an important place in education, finding the right competition as a student can be daunting especially in Mauritius where the few available competitions fly under the radar of educators and students. </p>
        <p>compete4moris aims to simplify the process of searching for competitions : By compiling high-quality competitions in a bite-size format, students can easily find a competition that interests them. On top of national competitions, some noteworthy international competitions have also been included in the list to encourage students to go beyond the national scope.</p>
