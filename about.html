      <h1>About us</h1>
      <p>
        While it is common knowledge that academic competitions hold an
        important place in education, finding the right competition as a student
        can be daunting especially in Mauritius where the few available
        competitions fly under the radar of educators and students.
      </p>
      <p>
        compete4moris aims to democratize access to competitions : By compiling
        high-quality competitions in a bite-size format, students can easily
        find a competition that interests them. Even though compete4moris
        focuses mainly on competitions in Mauritius, some noteworthy
        international competitions have also been included in the list to
        encourage students to go beyond the national scope.
